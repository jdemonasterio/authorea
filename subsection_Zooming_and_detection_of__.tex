From the first maps, we decided to focus visualizations in areas whose results were unexpected to the epidemiological collaborators. These antennas stand out for having a significantly higher link to the epidemic area than their adjacent antennas. The idea was to enhance the visualization focus in areas outside of Gran Chaco which could possibly host communities of migrants from the ecoregion.

Focused areas included the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Buenos Aires, with special focus on the metropolitan area of Greater Buenos Aires whose heatmaps are shown below.
