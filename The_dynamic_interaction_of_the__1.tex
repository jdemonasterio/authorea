The dynamic interaction of the triatomine infested areas and the human mobility patterns create a difficult scenario to track down individuals or spots with high prevalence of infected people or transmission risk. Available methods of surveying the state of the Chagas disease in Argentina nowadays are limited to individual screenings of individuals. The work described here is the first attempt to use mobile phone data to correlate migrations and cellphone usage to understand Chagasâ€™ epidemic spatial structure.

Recent national estimates indicate that there exist between 1.5 and 2 million individuals carrying the parasite, with more than seven million exposed. 
National health systems face many difficulties to effectively treat the disease. In the world, less than 1\% of infected people are diagnosed and treated (in Argentina, on average, about two thousand people are treated yearly). 
Even though governmental programs have been ongoing for years now~\cite{plan_nacional_chagas}, data on the issue is scarse or hardly accessible. This presents a real obstacle to ongoing research and coordination efforts to tackle the disease in the region.
