As a counter example, another algorithm was ran on the same problem as \ref{figure-lowROCAUC}.Notice how the algorithm is considered \textit{perfect} by the ROCAUC metric. No data transformation have been applied to the set between runs. The difference in the two scores is notable and corresponds entirely to the algorithm chosen.\footnote{The code used for this run can be found in a public iPython Notebook accessible in \url{https://github.com/jdemonasterio/authorea/blob/master/Notebooks/roc_curve_graph.ipynb}}
