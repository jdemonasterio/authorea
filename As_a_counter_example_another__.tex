As a counter example, another algorithm was ran on the same problem as \ref{figure-lowROCAUC}. Notice how the algorithm is considered almost \textit{perfect} by the ROCAUC metric. No additional data transformations have been applied after between runs. The difference in scores is notable and correspond entirely to the algorithms being used. \footnote{To replicate this test a public iPython Notebook has been set up at \url{https://github.com/jdemonasterio/authorea/blob/master/Notebooks/roc_curve_graph.ipynb} }
