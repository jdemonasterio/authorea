\section{Meta Section: Writing plan for this Chapter}

\section{Preamble}\label{section-preamble}
Most of the discussions in this chapter are based on information extracted from two distinguished textbooks: \ref{bishop - patternRecognition} and  \ref{hastie-elemstatslearn}. Some fundamental concepts and material were also used from \label{scikit-learn}. While other texts were also used, it is not necessary that we point them out here as they have been correctly cited. Where not specified, the reader can assume that the proof is based from said texts.
