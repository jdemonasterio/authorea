\subsection{Supervised Algorithms}

Classification algorithms for this first iteration are based on the most common techniques found in the literature for this task. Random forests, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression are standard for this kind of jobs. For the purpose of fast benchmarking Multinomial Naive Bayes is also tested since it is a very fast non-parametric method. 

Where possible, feature importance methods will be used to quantify the contribution of the feature or the interaction of features to the mobility of the users.
