$\Theta$

The objective function differences minimization objectives. 

Predictive power: how well the algorithm fits the data used for training and, hopefully, the \textit{true} underlying distribution

+ Regularization, favors parsimonious models. This is because all models approximate natural/processes to some degree, so if a simpler model can be used with the same predictive power, then this model should be used.  

\begin{equation} \label{eq:objFunction}
Obj(\Theta) \ = \ L(\Theta) + R(\Theta)
\\
%\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i x^i
\end{equation}

When building a model of ensemble trees, a higher model will be learning on other \textit{weaker} decision trees. If $Tr$ is a set of tree models, then $ y = \sum_k f_k(x) , \ f_k \in Tr \ \forall k $ and the objective function $Obj(\Theta) = \sum_i^n l(y_i,\hat{y_i}))  +  \sum_k R(f_k) $

Here we would have that
