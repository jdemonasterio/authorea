\section{Future Work}
Apply best fit model to Argentinian dataset. Provide that info to a Chagas risk model. Assuming that a high influx of individuals from epidemic regions is correlated with a higher risk in that area the algorithm could highlight these points.

TAG rural antennas.

FEATURE EXPLORATION. Hypothesis testing. 

SEASONAL MIGRATIONS AND OTHER regions

Search for EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA at a finer grain. (such as specific infection cases, ) Differencing the epidemic region on specific infection cases rather than on
Maybe even compare model with field results from NGOs partnered in this project.
