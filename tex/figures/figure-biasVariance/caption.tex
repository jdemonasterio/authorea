\label{figure-biasVariance} Figure borrowed from \cite{hastie-elemstatslearn} P. 220. Curves are measures of the estimated prediction error for the different degrees of freedom in the model (number of features). Blue curves correspond to the training error and red curves are for the test error. The bold curves are calculated by averaging over all of the colored curves.
