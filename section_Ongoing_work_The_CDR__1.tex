\section{Ongoing work}

The CDR logs available for Argentina span for 5 months, precluding the prediction of long-term mobilities using supervised algorithms. For the mexican dataset, users living in the ecoregion can be tested to their area of influence, looking back one year. Taking the period from January '14 to April '15 our target variable $Y $ is defined in the following way for every user $u$: 

% \eqref{PP1} reduces to
\[
    %\begin{equation}
    Y_u =
      \begin{cases}
        &1 \ \mbox{if} \ H_u \ \mbox{is from epidemic region}\\
        &0 \ \mbox{else}.
      \end{cases}
    %\end{equation}
    \]
